# Kusto in Notebooks & Interactive Window

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.kusto) that provides the ability to run Kusto queries in Notebooks as well as plain text files.

# Features

-   Run Kusto Queries
-   Graphs & Data Viewer
-   Code Completion
-   Syntax highlighting
-   Code refactoring
-   Code formatting
-   Kusto panel with access to Clusters, Databases, Tables, etc
-   Run Kusto queries in Plain text files, Notebooks or in an Interactive Window

# Getting Started

-   Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file and start typing to get code completion.
-   Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file and click on the `Run Query` code lense
-   Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file as a notebook
-   Create a file with extension `*.knb` (or use the command `Create Kusto Notebook`)
-   With text file (`*.kql`, `*.csl`) use the command `Configure Kusto Connection` to configure the Kusto connection for a .
-   With notebooks, select the cluster and database from via the Kernel Picker (or `Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel` command).

### Authentication Methods

The extension supports four ways to authenticate with Azure Data Explorer and will try each method in sequence until successful authentication is achieved:

1. **Azure CLI Authentication**
   - Uses existing Azure CLI credentials
   - Requires `az login` to be completed

2. **VS Code Azure Authentication**
   - Uses VS Code's built-in Azure authentication
   - No additional tools required

3. **Device Code Authentication**
   - Interactive device code flow
   - Enter code at microsoft.com/devicelogin

4. **Access Token Authentication**
   - Manual access token input
   - Useful for CI/CD scenarios

Note: For local development, Azure CLI or VS Code authentication is recommended.

# Works with Jupyter Notebooks as well (when using [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/))

-   This extension augments Jupyter Notebooks with Kusto language features, when using the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.
-   The extension will automatically detect the cluster and database from cells containing the connection information `kql AzureDataExplorer://code;cluster='help';database='Samples'`.

# Difference between Kusto Notebooks & Jupyter Notebooks (with [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/))

-   Kusto Notebooks, there are no additional dependencies.
    -   Authentication against Azure is handled by VS Code.
-   With Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to install Python and the [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/) package.
    -   You can use Python to further analyze the data.

# Roadmap

-   Support for more charts
